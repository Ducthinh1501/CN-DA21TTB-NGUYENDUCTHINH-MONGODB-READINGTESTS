    timeLimit: 20, // minutes
    passage: `Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. The Earth's average temperature has increased by about 1째C since pre-industrial times, primarily due to human activities. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide.

Scientists have observed various effects of this warming, including melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, and sea levels have risen by about 8 inches since 1900.

Many countries have pledged to reduce their carbon emissions through international agreements like the Paris Accord. However, some experts argue that current commitments are insufficient to prevent dangerous levels of warming. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important in the transition away from fossil fuels.`,

    title: "Reading Test 2: Ocean Pollution",
    timeLimit: 15,
    passage: `Ocean pollution has become a major environmental concern in recent decades. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter the oceans, forming large garbage patches in various parts of the world. The largest of these, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is estimated to cover an area three times the size of France.

Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to injury or death. Microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size, have been found in marine organisms from plankton to whales. These particles can accumulate toxins and move up the food chain, potentially affecting human health.

Recent studies have shown that plastic pollution reaches even the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists have discovered plastic bags and candy wrappers at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest known point on Earth. Some researchers estimate that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight.`,
